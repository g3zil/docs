### GRAPE-2 
The Grape 2 could be considered the 'big brother' of the GRAPE PSWS family. It is capable of receiving three frequencies simultaneously, utilizing a GPS disciplined oscillator for making precise frequency measurements.  A complete GRAPE 2 PSWS system consists of the following: Grape 2 Receiver and Logic PC boards, Teensy microcontroller, Raspberry Pi 4, external hard drive, power supply and two antennas, one for the GPS and one for the time standard frequencies. 

The GRAPE Version 2 hardware was designed by John Gibbons, N8OBJ, Lab Director of the Sears Undergraduate Electrical Design Lab, Case Western Reserve University.
