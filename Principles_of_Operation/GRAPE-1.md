# Principle of Operation - GRAPE-1 
The GRAPE-1 DRF system is designed to monitor how the Earth’s ionosphere changes over time.  It does this by continuously listening to a known, fixed-frequency, and stable HF time signal (Source).  These signals include WWV & WWVH (USA), CHU (Canada), RWM (Russia), and BPM (China).  The Grape-1 DRF platform mixes signals received with a GPSDO derived reference frequency set slightly away from that of a known HF time-signal station frequency.  The output of this mixing process produces an audible tone.  Variations in the frequency of that tone are directly related to changes in the Source frequency.  Tone frequency variation data is collected over time and stored in a digital format for subsequent analysis.  These data thus provide the means by which ionospheric changes may be monitored (Collins et al. 2021, Collins et al., 2022).
