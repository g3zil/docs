### WSPRDaemon GRAPE

The WPSRDaemon GRAPE SDR is the most sophisticated component of the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS).  It is a wide bandwidth SDR (software defined radio) system capable of receiving the entire MF and HF bands, converting radio signals into high speed digital data streams. It is able to measure Doppler shift while receiving multiple standard frequency stations (eg WWV and WWVH on five frequencies and CHU on three frequencies - simultaneously).  Further, it can decode WSPR/FST4W digital mode signals. All data is uploaded to HamSCI data servers for later research and analysis
