This plot had me scratching my head for some time. Why did strong time signals - presumably from WWV - suddenly stop exactly at 09:00 UTC ?  This is not just a single event, but occurs every day.  If it was the band suddenly closing, it was remarkably repeatable. The answer is that the signal that stops at 09:00 is not WWV, but BPM, the Chinese time signal, which is intentially switched off at 09:00 UTC. This time signal is transmitted from a site in eastern China, on exactly the same frequencies as WWV, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0 MHz.  London is very roughly half way on a great circle between WWV and BPM (7472 Km to WWV, 8225Km to BPM), so is well placed to observe both transmitters. 
    BPM transmits continuously on 5 and 10Mhz, but unlike WWV, the 15MHz BPM transmitter is only operational between 01:00 and 09:00 UTC, and on 2.5Mhz, the hours are restricted to 07:30 to 01:00.  From a latitude point of view, BPM is 34.948 degrees North, and WWV is 40.679 North, so WWV is some 640 Km further north,  - not a huge difference from an RF perspective. Looking at the day / night times, it is clear that the best reception from both stations occurs when both the tx and rx are in daylight, which implies .....
