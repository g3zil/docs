### Brief Introduction
On January 18, 2026, the Sun produced a long-duration X1.9-class solar flare. This strong flare launched a full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME) directed toward Earth. The results in this note were obtained just prior to, during and after this space weather event. The data were collected by a station in Keller, Texas (grid square EM12jw, near Fort Worth) while monitoring WWV on 10 MHz from Fort Collins, Colorado. The separation distance is approximately 1100 kilometers (about 680 miles). This means that signals from WWV in Fort Collins to north Texas travel through the D and E and often the F ionospheric regions. This distance also explains why both day/night and space-weather effects are observed along that path in the resulting spectrograms.
