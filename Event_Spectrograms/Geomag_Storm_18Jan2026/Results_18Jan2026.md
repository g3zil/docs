![Doppler Spectrogram of WWV 10 MHz at N6RFM on 18 January 2026](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25446894/Figure.1.18.January.2026.pdf)

* A.	~ 0000-0145 F region propagation with minimal, but variable Doppler, the path then rapidly closed. Very light thin-trace reflections above and below the main signal are Grape-1 receiver system mixing artifacts.
* B.	~ 0145-1000 Very weak, fuzzy (wide spectrum) trace consistent with two-hop sidescatter via the F region (Griffiths et al., 2023). Somewhat stronger signals with near zero-Doppler at B1 and B2 may have been from sporadic E (Es) propagation. Ionosonde data is very useful for checking the possibility of Es. However, ionosondes are few and those that openly report data even fewer. The ionosonde near Austin TX, some 800 km SSE of the WWV-N6RFM midpoint did show weak Es around 0600 UTC (click AU930 then find date at https://giro.uml.edu/ionoweb/#).
* C.	~0700-1530 and later are likely interference rather than WWV-related.
* D.	~ 1345 Dramatic F region one-hop propagation opening close to local sunrise with weaker lower amplitude (D1 yellow) trace likely representing a higher-elevation path.  The positive and reducing Doppler is consistent with morning descending height of reflection. D2, the yellow curl above the one-hop F region Doppler in red, is two-hop F region propagation involving four passes through the D and E region resulting in additional absorption hence a weaker signal. The subsequent yellow trace is variable Doppler via the two-hop mode.
* E.	~ 1400- 1930 F region propagation path open, then closes, but with very weak two-hop sidescatter persisting, then reopens. 
* F.	~ 2030-2345 First, weak E region propagation with near-zero Doppler, then both F region one-hop (red) and weaker and more variable (yellow) propagation is observed.  The latter is consistent with two-hop F region propagation.
